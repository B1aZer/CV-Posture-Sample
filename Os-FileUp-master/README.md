# Project Os - File Upload

<img src="Logotype primary.png" width="200" height="" />

Os-FileUp is an Android WebView Project to help app developers understand how to upload and process image for any hybrid app. This project explains the usage of gallery and camera intent.

## Getting Started
This project contains android application build files, that you can download and use directly in your latest Android Studio. Follow further steps to get started in your personalised environment.

### Requirements
The project requires minimum Android API 16+ (4.1 JellyBean) SDK *(it all works but looks kinda ugly in JB)*.
You can use any IDE of your choice but to be specific, I used latest Android Studio *(till the last project update)* with updated SDKs and Build.

### Test Run
Clean and Rebuild project in your programming environment. Once you are done fixing error(s) *(incase if any shows up)*, you'll be ready to dive deeper.

### Permissions
Followings are permissions required for all the mentioned features to work.
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
```
`INTERNET` permission is required to access online content and `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`+`CAMERA` permissions to take photo from camera and save it to gallery.

`PROJECT NOTE: *Android 4.4 doesn't support webview upload default method and it's a permanent bug as no more KitKat updates are going to be made. All other versions are working fine.*`

**A personal note:** `You all must keep up with programming. Sometimes it's difficult and other times easy but fun afterall. You can create your own world with programming and that's what makes this job interesting. All the best for your next creation.`
